# MERN simple example

If you clone this project, you just need to ```npm install```, update your MongoDB Atlas username and password in the mongoose.connect, and then run.

If you want to creat from scratch:  
1. We need to install ```Node.js``` first
1. Create an empty project: ```npm init```
1. Add Express.js: ```npm install express```
1. Add mongoose: ```npm i mongoose```
1. Run by ```node index.js```
1. But you better ```npm i --global nodemon``` and the run as ```nodemon index.js```, so you will not have to stop and re-run server in case of changes.
